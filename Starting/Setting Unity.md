# Setting Unity

Ok, this shouldn't be a bother. But I'm using and old installation of Unity I had and I'll update it as I have the settings today 29/11/2020.


## Setting the Github and these pages

I made this documentation repo because I did [fabacademy](http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/) and now I'm used to document things.

If you want more info on how I got into the git thingy, [you can look here](http://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/assignments/week02/#2-project-management)

Even if I use git as usual, to do this bare website (That I might use or improve in the future) I had installed [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (bash and gui) and [tortoise git](https://tortoisegit.org/) (just because it has a direct "clone here") and made a folder to hold everything.

I'm using [Atom](https://atom.io/) as a text editor

I already had an account in github. Then I follow the steps to create a new repository. I'm using markdown files that I write in my computer in Atom and I upload them to this repository.

For creating my local repo I had to copy my ssh key. To do that I think that probably there is a gui bash command. But since I'm to _lazy_ to remember o to look for it in the internet, I opened the git GUI (Graphical User interface) and navigating into those menus in help->show SSH key I found what I needed.

_SSH don't share it unless you have to_

Then I set that SSH Key into github so github recognizes this computer and user as _me_. If you do it with other computer you'll need to copy or add another SSH Key.

Now I'm ready to clone the repo. I copied the **HTTPS** option, it doesn't seem to work with SSH.

_this is the thing to copy to clone a repo_

Then to clone the repo I made a folder called repo and then go to-> right click in the white space of the folder -> git clone... and then see if everything is ok.

Then I made the folders. And try to make a first try push. It seems that even if git is integrated into atom (that's why I'm using it), you have to login _again_ into Github. At least you only have to do it once.

I also tested how the images are shown and linked so if I push screenshots you can see them nicely.

_this is my atomUI and what I see when I document_
