# Setting Unity

Ok, this shouldn't be a bother. But I'm using and old installation of Unity I had and I'll update it as I have the settings today 29/11/2020.


## Setting the Github

Even if I use git as usual, to do this bare website (That I might use or improve in the future) I had installed [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (bash and gui) and [tortoise git](https://tortoisegit.org/) (just because it has a direct "clone here") and made a folder to hold everything.

I'm using [Atom](https://atom.io/) as a text editor
